## Videos Folder (`/assets/videos/`)

Add the following file:
- `background.mp4` - A short (15-30 second) video that will play in the background of your header section. This should be compressed for web viewing (recommended 1280x720 or 1920x1080 resolution, <5MB file size).

Look for abstract technology or coding themes that match your portfolio style.

## Images Folder (`/assets/images/`)

Add the following file:
- `profile.jpg` - Your professional headshot or avatar image (recommended square aspect ratio, at least 400x400 pixels).
