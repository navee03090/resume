This is a placeholder for a PDF resume.

In a real portfolio, this would be replaced with an actual PDF resume.

The resume should include:
- Education
- Work experience
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact information

You can create a PDF resume using tools like:
- Microsoft Word (Save as PDF)
- Google Docs (Export as PDF)
- Adobe InDesign
- Canva
- Resume builder websites

Remember to update the links in index.html and resume.html to point to your actual resume.pdf file when you create it.
