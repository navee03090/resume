# Image Placeholder

## Profile Image

Place your profile image (named `profile.jpg`) in this directory. This image will be displayed in the hero section of your portfolio website.

## Requirements

- File Name: `profile.jpg`
- Format: JPG or PNG format
- Aspect Ratio: Preferably square (1:1)
- Resolution: At least 400x400 pixels (higher resolution is better)
- Type: Professional headshot or avatar image

## Alternative

If you don't add a profile image, a placeholder will be displayed instead. However, a personal photo helps create a connection with visitors to your portfolio.

## Project Images

You can also add project screenshots to this directory for use in the Projects section. 
Name them descriptively (e.g., `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`) and update the HTML to reference these images.
